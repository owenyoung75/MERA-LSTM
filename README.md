## MERA-LSTM

This is an public repository for the work _Entanglement-Structured LSTM Boosts Chaotic TimeSeries Forecasting_. 
Mainly two sets of information are included here:    
1. [Code implementation for experiments](https://github.com/owenyoung75/MERA-LSTM/tree/main/code);    
2. [Related instructional/explanational materials](https://github.com/owenyoung75/MERA-LSTM/tree/main/materials).    


- The [material folder]((https://github.com/owenyoung75/MERA-LSTM/tree/main/materials)) contains mainly slides used previously in off-line seminars/workshops by authors.
More informaton about original ideas and motivations could be found in slides, which are more detailed compared with the manuscript.

- For the [code implementation](https://github.com/owenyoung75/MERA-LSTM/tree/main/code) part, to make the result and experiments more transparent and reproducible, instead of a package of codes in a script language only, we implement the newly proposed model using a [Mathematica](https://www.wolfram.com/mathematica/) notebook, which contains all params and result numbers&figures, making results directly visible.
