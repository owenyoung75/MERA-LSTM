# TN_SeqModeling

### Implementation of tensor-network models in sequencial modeling.


#### Model type:
- Recerrent-structure-based models, using hidden variables;
- State-variable-based models.

#### Representation type:
- Polynomial-lattice representation, single-site-dimension = HL + 1
- Timelag-lattice representation, single-site-dimension = HP + 1
